Cosmogenic Exposure Age Averages (CEAA)

 These Matlab/Octave scripts show different methods to calculate an average (average ± deviation)
 from a set of gaussian data (typically Cosmogenic exposure ages).
 Input data in .csv file containing 4 columns: 
 sample names , ages , internal uncertainties , external uncertainties
 First line of the csv file (header) is ignored.
 
Just run start and select your file.
 
A detailed description will be added to my blog www.angelrodes.com soon.
